In this notebook, you will learn how to use the Unity ML-Agents environment for the first project of the [Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893).

### 1. Start the Environment

We begin by importing some necessary packages.  If the code cell below returns an error, please revisit the project instructions to double-check that you have installed [Unity ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Installation.md) and [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/).


```python
#from mlagents_envs.environment import UnityEnvironment
from unityagents import UnityEnvironment
import torch
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
```

Replace with if needed
```


```python
env = UnityEnvironment(file_name="Banana_Windows_x86_64/Banana.exe")
```

    INFO:unityagents:
    'Academy' started successfully!
    Unity Academy name: Academy
            Number of Brains: 1
            Number of External Brains : 1
            Lesson number : 0
            Reset Parameters :
    		
    Unity brain name: BananaBrain
            Number of Visual Observations (per agent): 0
            Vector Observation space type: continuous
            Vector Observation space size (per agent): 37
            Number of stacked Vector Observation: 1
            Vector Action space type: discrete
            Vector Action space size (per agent): 4
            Vector Action descriptions: , , , 
    

Environments contain **_brains_** which are responsible for deciding the actions of their associated agents. Here we check for the first brain available, and set it as the default brain we will be controlling from Python.


```python
# get the default brain
brain_name = env.brain_names[0]
brain = env.brains[brain_name]
```


```python
from dqn_agent import Agent

agent = Agent(state_size=37, action_size=4, seed=0)
```

### 4. Test the trained agent


```python
# load the weights from file
agent.qnetwork_local.load_state_dict(torch.load('checkpoint_nav.pth'))
```


```python
env_info = env.reset(train_mode=False)[brain_name] # reset the environment
state = env_info.vector_observations[0]            # get the current state
score = 0                                          # initialize the score
while True:
    action = agent.act(state)        # select an action
    env_info = env.step(action)[brain_name]        # send the action to the environment
    next_state = env_info.vector_observations[0]   # get the next state
    reward = env_info.rewards[0]                   # get the reward
    done = env_info.local_done[0]                  # see if episode has finished
    score += reward                                # update the score
    state = next_state                             # roll over the state to next time step
    if done:                                       # exit loop if episode finished
        break
    
print("Score: {}".format(score))
```

    Score: 15.0
    

When finished, you can close the environment.


```python
env.close()
```


```python

```
